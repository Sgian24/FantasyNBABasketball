# NBA Fantasy Visualizer

A web app I developed to visualize NBA player stats with graphs. Users can create an account to draft and save their own roster. Data is fetched from 3 different APIs. Responsive on all screen sizes.

Tools Used:

* React
* Various APIs from RapidAPI
* Axios
* Firebase Authentication and Firestore
* Bootstrap
* React Router
* Recharts
