# NBA Fantasy Visualizer

A web app I developed to present NBA player statistics in graphical form. Users can sign in to create and save their own roster. Data 
is fetched from the "tank01-fantasy-stats" API (RapidAPI)

Tools Used:

* React
* Axios
* Firebase Authentication and Firestore
* Bootstrap
* React Router
* Recharts
* Formik and Yup Form Validation
